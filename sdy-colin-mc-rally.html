Компьютер, руль и педали. Если вы запускаете «Need for Speed» раз в неделю, можно ответить на этот вопрос однозначно: нет. Title says it all. I’ve driven in anger and instructed in most types of rally cars including the latest R2’s and so on, and have competed in rounds of the WRC. I also loved the dirt series and Colin McRae Rally, although I only bought a decent wheel set-up for DR2. I’d be happy to answer any questions about my opinions on the game, the handling, pacenotes or anything. Although, I’d rather keep my ID under wraps for now, as I don’t want to ostracise myself for any future potential associations. Если не запускается все равно, тогда читаем ниже. Хотя игра не слишком требовательна у многих она не работает и вылетает. 
I've long been a fan of rallying, since I was 7-8 years old. As for this question, this only applies to new cars currently available. For me, I'd go with any of these: ##Lincoln Continental V6 sedan I'd either keep the 400hp V6 engine, or replace it with something like the Lexus RC F Sport 5.0-liter/467hp V8 if it would fit in the engine bay. The Tesla Model S Ludicrous 595hp/444kW electric motor could work, but charging times probably would be an issue here. As a rally car, it'd proba.

Hey guys, first I wanted to say that I mean no disrespect to the legend himself with this post. But my question is: Why does Colin McRae seem to kinda be portrayed as the poster boy of rally (atleast this is how newbies see it) when he doesn’t have near as much success as say makinen or the Sebastian’s. Even his teammates in the same cars had similar levels of success but don’t seem to be mentioned as often. Thankyou guys in advance though for the answers/opinions.

Great game, was looking forward to the sequel. I was going to pre-purchase the Deluxe Edition of Dirt Rally 2.0. Won't be doing that anymore and will buy it only once you (codies) have removed the online requirement from the My Team/Career (single player) part of the game. I don't want to have progress deleted because of faulty online servers or any other connection hiccup. It would 
I was starting to play a bit of Colin McRae rally 2 from done years ago, and it's a lot of fun. I'm quite amazed of the feeling of speed, and just how good it looks with what it has to work with, yeah, the people and trees are flat, and the textures are quite washed out, but the game is so much fun still, now many years since I bought and played it the first.

Also interested in smaller games, willing to look at any offers. You can also buy me a game on Steam if you tell me how much you're willing to pay in exchange for something. AC Origins, The Division and 7 Days to Die gone, already received. Colin McRae Rally is the series which began the Dirt series. You might remember Colin McRae Rally (1998), Colin McRae Rally 2.0 (2000) and Colin McRae Rally 3 (2002) from your childhood, all these games were quite innovative for their time especially in the racing games scene. The games are no longer being sold and are considered abandonware (i.e. there's no way to play these games unless you find a used copy somewhere). If you are interested in trying out the first Colin McRae Rally games #Overview The second of a fourteen round season, Rally Sweden is currently the only full snow rally on the calendar. A classic winter fixture that spans two countries as it ventures deep into the frozen and remote forests of Sweden and Norway. Studded tyres provide remarkable grip on snow and ice. Paradoxically, it is one of the season’s fastest rounds. #The Stages - Action begins with big power slides at Thursday night’s spectacular super special stage at Karlstad trotting track, which Really want to try rally sims but I don't have anything but a gamepad and I have no experience with sim games at all. What rally game would you suggest? It can be quite an old game and really it can be borderline an arcade game, but for PC, preferebly 2001- and up. I have a weak rig, so Dirt Rally and everything newer than that is a no-go. I was thinking about trying Colin McRae Rally (the 2014 PC port of the mobile game) but I heard bad things about it. Thanks. I listen to his stuff first and foremost to hear about games. He's the only person I've found that lines up with my tastes - no multiplayer, no loot boxes, just good, well designed single-player games, with a bent towards nostalgia for classic games of the past. I've been listening since Beyond, and while his political asides were bearable, almost cute that that time and at Kinda Funny, I had to stop after CLS, just because it became cringey to listen to. I dip back in every once in a while. Done a lot of reading on 4K monitors/refresh rates before posting:-) I want to move to a 40 inch monitor so I can sit in a rally seat (not at my desk) and play the games - sad I know! I've come down to a short list of Acer ET430K or Philips Brilliance BDM4350UC based on being a well priced IPS panel with a reasonable response time of 5ms and supporting DP 1.2/HDMI 2.0. Two questions: 1. I can't find any 40" G-Sync monitors, never mind at a price I'm willing to pay, would it be worth 
It seems that just about every day someone posts asking about various games being made available through backwards compatibility. OG Xbox titles in particular are a hot topic, likely due to the relatively small number currently available. Rather than offer another opinion, I thought I'd make a post of all the possible games, and a little context about the current status of a small handful of them. This list consists of just under half of all games released on the original Xbox. If a game doesn't. Just picked this up, after playing the classic Colin McRae games as a kid and a couple of the older DiRT titles, and I've got to admit, I'm really struggling with the rallies in career mode. I've done a few RX races, and I absolutely trounced the AI in them, pulling a good 10 second lead in some of the qualifiers. But in the rallies, I consistently seem to do atrociously, lagging behind by insane amounts. I can do alright in shakedowns, but I just end up being behind by miles in the actual.

I'm just getting in to motorsports, rally and touring cars in particular. I'm wondering which WRC drivers and teams are worth keeping an eye on. I really like independent teams, especially those that aren't operating on relatively big budgets. The underdogs, I guess. The only drivers I know of right now are big names like Ken Block, Walter Rohrl, Michele Mouton, Colin McRae Thanks

Hey everyone! Just found this sub thanks to one of the mods at HQ. Since we're a tiny sub right now, can y'all give me some more info on what town you're from, what you're currently doing school/work/retirement wise, and what your goals are for the primary season?
